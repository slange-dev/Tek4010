Tek4010 on Windows
==================

tek4010 can also be built on Windows. It uses
virtualization with WSL, which is available for free
on most PC systems. If you are prepared to use the
command line interface, proceed as follows:

Open a terminal window and type

1. wsl --install -d Ubuntu

2. Then reboot your system.

3. After the reboot you will be asked for a user name and
   a password for Ubuntu. These will be your Linux
   credentials. They do not need to be identical with
   your windows credentials.

Note, on Ubuntu, there is no root password. Use your
normal password in sudo below.

You should now find a Ubuntu and a wsl icon in your
start menu. Start either one of them.

4. sudo apt-get update

5. sudo apt-get upgrade

4. sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev

5. sudo apt-get install make

6. sudo apt-get install gcc

7. sudo apt-get install pkg-config

8. git clone https://github.com/rricharz/Tek4010

9. cd Tek4010

10. make clean

11. make

12. make install

13. Add PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH" to your ~/.zprofile file

14. Reboot your PC

15. Test with
        cd Tek4010
        make check
